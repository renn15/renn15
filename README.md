- 👋 Oh hi guys, my name is Darren, that's why my username is @renn15.
- 👀 I’m interested in way too many things, but in this context, I like studying coding, data analysis, and physics.
- 🎮 I'm also playing way too many video games, mainly puzzles and rhythm games.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning general programming (with Python) and web development (javascript), but I'm also interested in other things like game development and shaders [Refer to StudyList.md](StudyList.md). (one day I'll tackle that)
- 💞️ I’m not looking for collaboration (for reasons mentioned above) but if you have some weird ideas I might help. But hey at least I've figured out how to collab with github.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him (dia if you're Indonesian)
- ⚡ Fun fact: did you know?
